#### My Side Projects

[**SimFN**](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/SimFN) & [**Integrator2**](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/Integrator2) | Java,C/C++ 
- A graphing calculator that takes string input to plot functions.
- I had to build a:
	- **Lexer (Tokenizer)**: Breaks down the string into keywords.
	- **Parser**: Created an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) to convert infix notation to postfix for easier tree construction.
	- **Evaluator**: The function that evaluates the AST for various input values.
- Everything, including the AST, was implemented from scratch. Swing was used for the GUI.
- This experience taught me the fundamentals of language creation and semantics in Java using an OOP paradigm.
- **Integrator2** is an older version of this project implemented in C and C++, which also includes numeric integration.

[**BlochSphere**](https://klevisimeri.github.io/BlochSphere/) | Svelte, Bun, Vite.js, Three.js
- Interactive quantum Bloch sphere simulator in browser. 
- Supports matrix-vector ops, real-time 3D visualization, and custom JS scripting. 
- Used Threlte + Math.js for rendering and computation.
- This is work under development. You can find more information in the [specification](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/BlochSphere/blob/main/BlochSphereSimulator.pdf).

[**Pipes In The Desert**](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/Pipes-In-The-Desert) | Java
- A group software project with 4 members.
- Learned to collaborate effectively and manage complex version control.
- Project phases included requirements gathering, design, implementation, and testing.
- The project followed a design-first approach, involving:
	- **Model Design**: Created class diagrams to structure the model.
	- **Behavior Design**: Developed sequence diagrams to illustrate interactions.
	- **User Interaction Design**: Used use case diagrams to capture user interactions.
	- **Component Design**: Employed component diagrams to organize system dependencies.
- Developed custom testing methods and a specific testing project language.
- Swing was used for the UI. 

[**CleanEdit**](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/CleanEdit) | TypeScript, Vue, Tailwind, C#, FFmpeg, Python 
- A fast, web-based video editor.
- **Frontend**: 
    - Built with Vue.js, leveraging reactivity (ref(), computed()), lifecycle hooks (onMount()), and DOM manipulation for dynamic UI interactions.
- **Backend**: 
    - Designed a RESTful API using C# ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework for database management and ORM capabilities.
    - Integrated FFmpeg and Python’s auto-edit package for video processing and auto-cutting.
    - Implemented a secure authentication system using JWT tokens and user sessions.
- **Styling**: Used Tailwind for efficient CSS styling.

> *Note:* **Many** other projects are available on my GitHub.

#### Random Things About Me

- My last role was as a **Full-Stack Engineer**, where I successfully completed a project that is now running 24/7, requiring only occasional maintenance and log assessments.  
- Recently, I’ve been exploring new fields and expanding my knowledge, which led me to **formal verification**, a field I find highly promising and enjoyable. With the ever-increasing computing power, I believe that in the future I will be able to apply it to many areas, including **networks**, **security**, and high-level **software programming**.
(Still seems hard, but we engineers are magicians.)
- I am currently studying the **CyberOps Cisco course** and **CCNA2** at BME, which has provided me with solid expertise in networking and hands-on experience managing Cisco switches and routers.  
- My preferred daily operating system is **Linux** with the **i3 tiling window manager**.
- My favorite editor is [**plain Neovim**](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/nvim), as it allows faster text processing and easy automation.  
- My favorite programming language is **C**, for its simplicity and explicitness—leaky abstractions are unavoidable.  
- My career aspiration is to work in **low-level programming**, ideally on large, legacy C codebases such as operating systems or specialized hardware.  
- I am deeply passionate about **automation** and aim to learn as much as possible in this field throughout my life.  
- I am not active on **social media** and value **real-life interactions**, so I prefer working in a **physical workplace** instead of remotely.
- One of the **goals** in my life is to meet the **most amazing engineers** and **researchers** of our era.
